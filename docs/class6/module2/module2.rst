DDoS Hybrid Defender Attacks and Mitigations
============================================

In this module you will create Protected Objects, Set Mitigation Thresholds Manually, and then launch various attacks against the |f5| |dhd| and view the results in the GUI and logs. Then you will allow the |dhd| to Automatically detect and set Threshold for detection and mitigation, easing the burden on Administartors.
Finally, time permitting, we will explore Behavioral mitigations. (Covered in Detail in the Advanced class)
