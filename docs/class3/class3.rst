F5 Agility Lab Day:  DDoS Hybrid Defender
=========================================

DDoS Hybrid Defender, a hybrid DDoS solution that offers comprehensive
protection, high availability, and is easy to deploy and manage. It
guards against aggressive volumetric and targeted DDoS attacks, includes
hardware-assisted DDoS mitigation, and optionally, connects with
Silverline, a cloud-based scrubbing service.

This class covers the following topics:

- Initial Set-up, Device Configuration and working with basic device-level
  DDoS vectors to mitigate the most commonly encountered attacks. Then we will
  cover Auto-thresholding, bad actor detection, DNS reflection and
  amplification, real-time blackholing, mitigation of L7 floods, low-and-slow
  attacks and behavioral attacks.
